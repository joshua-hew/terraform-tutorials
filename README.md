# Learning Terraform

This repo contains terraform config files used to follow along with the official [Terraform tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform)

My goals for learning Terraform is three-fold:
- Learn the basic concepts
- Go through the AWS tutorial
- Deploy a basic todo app on AWS using Terraform

Bonus:
- Deploy the same todo app on Azure and Google Cloud
